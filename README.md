## Deep Learning Frameworks Optimizing Forward Looking Portfolio Strategies
This project optimizes financial portfolios and evaluates them using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network ML. 

### Objective:
The goal is to leverage historical stock price data to train an LSTM model, it's usage of forward predictions, and utilize these predictions to fully optimize and manage an artificial financial portfolio. Periodically, the portfolio is altered/rebalanced  indiciated by the LSTM predicted stock returns. Furthermore, investments from individual stocks and the overall portfolio are re-evaluated accordingly and visualized to easily analyze overall performance of portfolio compared w/individual stock returns.
